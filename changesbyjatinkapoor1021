I am Jatin Kapoor, jatinkapoor1021 my git name, and i forked your repo and read your code and went through it to see what change you could make and how you
could improve. I went through your code, and there isnt much you could change or fix, the code is pretty good, runs well and you completed it well, one thing
i will say is you could perhaps make the code a bit more concise. I compared it to my code and for like the cpp files i was able to complete the functions 
in some less lines than you, so perhaps that is an area you could improve in, but even then its very minor. You did a good job
